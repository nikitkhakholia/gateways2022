          CHRIST (Deemed to be University) was born out of the educational
          vision of St Kuriakose Elias Chavara, an educationalist and social
          reformer of the nineteenth century in South India. He founded the
          first Catholic indigenous congregation, Carmelites of Mary Immaculate
          (CMI), in 1831 which administers CHRIST (Deemed to be University).

          Established in 1969 as Christ College, it undertook path-breaking
          initiatives in Indian higher education with the introduction of

          imparting of Holistic Education and adoption of global higher
          education practices with the support of creative and dedicated staff.

          Christ College in 2004 and identified it as an Institution with
          Potential for Excellence in 2006. In 2008 under Section 3 of the UGC
          Act, 1956, the Ministry of Human Resource Development of the
          Government of India, declared the institution a Deemed to be
          University, in the name and style of Christ University. One of the
          first institutions in India to be accredited in 1998 by the NAAC, and
          subsequently in 2004 and 2016, CHRIST (Deemed to be University) has
